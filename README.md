# Implementing-a-Simple-neural-net-using-CUDA
Implemented a simple neural network using CUDA which can be used to classify instances from the Fashion_MNIST dataset


## Have written a CPU code which has the architecture to classify images. Right now the CPU code only has the architecture.
### To do: add in functions to take in images and import kernels for different layers.
